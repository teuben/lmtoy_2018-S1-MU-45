L1157-B1  (VLSR=3) at 95.9550 GHz

## OBSNUM

A total of 16 obsnums were taken, of which 15 are ok. One map is partial, and it was skipped
(but might be salvagable)

Current RMS is down to 9.3 mK.

In the Nov data beam 9 looks perfect (not affected by doppler), but the
*Spectra for the whole map, overplotted for each beam* look like that
beam has a deviant spectrum

L1157-B1a.reg   - two ds9 regions, one is the formal center, the polygon some area where "all" of the central emission is.
